Code Example:
javascript
class CrossChainDebitCard {
    constructor() {
        this.cardBalances = {};
    }

    loadCard(cardId, amount, chain) {
        this.cardBalances[cardId] = (this.cardBalances[cardId] || 0) + amount;
        console.log(`Loaded ${amount} to card ${cardId} on ${chain}`);
    }

    async makePurchase(cardId, amount, currency) {
        if (this.cardBalances[cardId] >= amount) {
            this.cardBalances[cardId] -= amount;
            console.log(`Purchase of ${amount} ${currency} made with card ${cardId}`);
        } else {
            console.log("Insufficient balance on card");
        }
    }
}
