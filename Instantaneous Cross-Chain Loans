Code Example:
javascript
class CrossChainLoan {
    constructor() {
        this.loans = {};
    }

    createLoan(loanId, borrower, amount, collateralChain) {
        this.loans[loanId] = { borrower, amount, collateralChain, status: 'active' };
        console.log(`Loan created: ${loanId} for ${borrower} of amount ${amount} on ${collateralChain}`);
    }

    repayLoan(loanId) {
        const loan = this.loans[loanId];
        if (loan && loan.status === 'active') {
            loan.status = 'repaid';
            console.log(`Loan ${loanId} has been repaid by ${loan.borrower}`);
        } else {
            console.log("Loan not found or already repaid");
        }
    }
}
