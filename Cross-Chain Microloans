 Code Example (Cross-Chain Microloans via Reclaim):
```solidity
// Solidity contract for Cross-Chain Microloans

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CrossChainMicroloans {
    struct Loan {
        address borrower;
        uint256 amount;
        bool repaid;
    }

    mapping(address => Loan[]) public loans;

    event LoanRequested(address indexed borrower, uint256 amount);

    function requestLoan(uint256 _amount) public {
        loans[msg.sender].push(Loan(msg.sender, _amount, false));
        emit LoanRequested(msg.sender, _amount);
    }

    function repayLoan(uint256 _loanIndex) public payable {
        require(msg.value == loans[msg.sender][_loanIndex].amount, "Incorrect loan repayment amount");
        loans[msg.sender][_loanIndex].repaid = true;
        emit LoanRepaid(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }

    function checkCreditworthiness(address _borrower) external view returns (bool) {
        // Integrate with Reclaim for creditworthiness
        return true; // For simplicity, assume all borrowers are creditworthy
    }
